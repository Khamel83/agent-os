# Agent OS - Khamel83 Edition

## Your system for spec-driven agentic development + intelligent cost optimization.

**Based on [Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os) by Brian Casel** - This enhanced edition adds cost optimization strategies that achieve **$50 worth of AI results for $1** using intelligent task decomposition and model routing.

**Original**: Transforms AI coding agents from confused interns into productive developers.  
**Enhanced**: Transforms them into *cost-efficient* productive developers.

## 🚀 One-Command Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Khamel83/agent-os/main/install.sh | bash
```

Works with:

✅ **Claude Code** (CLAUDE.md configuration)  
✅ **Cursor** (.cursorrules configuration)  
✅ **Gemini CLI** (GEMINI.md configuration)  
✅ **Ralex** (enhanced intelligent routing)  

✅ New products or established codebases.  
✅ Big features, small fixes, or anything in between.  
✅ Any language or framework.  
✅ **NEW**: Cost optimization built-in.

## 💰 Cost Optimization Features

### The $50 → $1 Strategy
- **Planning Phase**: Expensive models for architecture (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- **Implementation**: Cheap models for code generation (Llama 3.1 8B)
- **Review**: Medium models for debugging (Claude Haiku)
- **Caching**: Reuse successful patterns

### What You Get
- Task breakdown templates
- LiteLLM routing configurations  
- Cost tracking and analytics
- Pattern caching system
- Ralex integration guides

### Example Savings
- **REST API Development**: $35 → $2.10 (94% savings)
- **Database Schema**: $25 → $1.80 (93% savings)
- **Authentication System**: $50 → $2.20 (95.6% savings)
