# Cost Savings Tracker

Track your AI development cost savings using Agent-OS optimization strategies.

## How to Use
1. **Before Starting**: Estimate traditional cost for the task
2. **During Work**: Break down using templates and track actual usage
3. **After Completion**: Document savings and patterns for future use
